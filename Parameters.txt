1. Log options
The log options specify how the output should look like, and what needs to be
printed to the output.
There are 3 log levels, -v, -vv and -vvv.
-v	Is the one that shows the least information, its different for each header,
   	but the most common are: Layer, Source and Destination.
-vv	Same as -v, but shows also time, length, and more for each header.
-vvv	Shows all possible info, header options, checksum, Protocols, etc.

The packet delay specifys the time between each packet to show.
The default is 200ms, which means theres a 200 milliseconds wait time before
the next packet with information shows on the output (if logging is enabled).

If you specify -o and/or -oh, the packet will be displayed. The ASCII will just
show the packet as it is, but 'dot' the characters it can't display. IE. (hex) 01
it can't display, so it will replace it with a dot. It will show (hex) 00 as a new
line.
The hex format will show the output in hex with the ascii text next to it, but as
with the ASCII it will also dot the characters out that are invalid to display.
The difference is that it won't display (hex) 00 and newline as a newline.

-ph means it will also show the packet headers data, instead of leaving it out.
Use it together with -o or/and -oh if wanted to see the header data.


2. Options
Use -pl to see a list of devices ID to use to snif on/send to.
Use -i <n> to see specific info for device <n>.
If you dont have WinPCap installed and just want to see your NIC info, use -wl

To use a filter, use -f <filter>, the filter has to be surrounded with quotes
in order for WinPCap to understand and compile/use the filter.
For a list of filters options for WinPCap, look at
www.winpcap.org/docs/docs31/html/group__language.html

If you want to snif, use -snif <n>, where n is the device ID from -pl.
If you want to send a packet, use -send <n>, where n is the device ID from -pl.
